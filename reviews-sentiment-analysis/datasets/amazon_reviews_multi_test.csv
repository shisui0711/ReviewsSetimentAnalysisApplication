Don‚Äôt waste your time!,"These are AWFUL. They are see through, the fabric feels like tablecloth, and they fit like children‚Äôs clothing.

Gold filled earrings,You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma,en_0963290,1
Poor container,The glue works fine but the container is impossible to work with. The cap doesn't come off without plyers and then won't go back on without a violent abrupt force involving both hands and a solid object (desk drawer). This happened even though I was careful to not gum up the lid or tapering snout.,en_0238156,1

Very brittle case,"Gotta say, not impressed with the quality. I mean, I can't say I expected it to be overwhelmingly amazing with the cost being where it's at. But, certainly I thought it would last longer than a few days. Had the phone in my gym bag. Slid out from the side and barely tapped the wall. On the aluminum side. Not even on the glass. And low and behold, instantaneous crack. Oddly enough, just on the back. Not a splinter at all on the front. Not sure if the back is intentionally more susceptible to damage or just my luck. Either way, I have to give this product a thumbs down. Wish it held up better. It really is a nice design. I am a fan of how the product looks and the concept. No issue there. Just not durable at all.",en_0363796,1

"Nice idea, but broke almost instantly","Had them for like a month, during which time I used them maybe once for 5 minutes. Otherwise kept in the included case. They broke right away. The nosepiece - which is made of a paper-like material glued to a tiny strip of clear plastic - snapped the second time I tried to wear them. Since it's the only thing that holds them up, the glasses essentially became trash after that. Don't waste your time no matter how deep the discount.",en_0034970,1

This does not stick well or weed well!,"The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times!

Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!,"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",en_0530458,1

"Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield.

It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA.

Drops internet,"I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet.

Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris.

NO Amazon for black friday or christmas,"let me start off by saying this is not a bad rating for the product but rather Amazon for not delivering on time. So my order was over 8 days ago and Amazon barely shipped my package. All I received was an email indicating that the package would be late. The website continues to indicate that there were 15 miter saws still in stock. So when I get the shipping email, it moves the date by 5 additional days. No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service?

After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",en_0102261,1

"Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.","I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.",en_0173136,1

Terrible audio feedback,"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk.

I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio.

It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine.

"Doesn't actually do any air ""cleaning""","Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",en_0049094,2

Good when they worked - failed after 4 months,"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them.

"So far, not impressed.","My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I‚Äôm not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life.

Update on battery,"Although it appears to be a genuine Sony battery, it held less charge when I got it in 2017 than the battery that came with the camera that was a couple of years older.

I'm hoping it will do better. 2019 update. I'll stick with my 2 star rating. The battery I got appears to be a genuine Sony and has the hologram. However, it doesn't hold a charge as well as the one that came with the camera back in 2014.

In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced.

My thoughts after 2 weeks of use,"Firstly don't believe the rating here. Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it. If you're debating whether to get it or not, don't trust the positive reviews here and forget about it -- it does not worth $250 (or even $150) yet.",en_0488250,2

is a game of luck,"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses.

Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter.

Skirt fits tight/narrow over plus size shorts,"Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5‚Äô8‚Äô‚Äô size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it‚Äôs for not showing anything on the front? But it‚Äôs stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it‚Äôs waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I‚Äôm cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it‚Äôs wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts.

Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road.

Too dark,"I'm in a Shakespeare course and this adaptation sticks pretty close to the text. It was helpful to watch what I was having trouble envisioning while reading. The acting is marvelous, but the production quality is disappointing. It is SO incredibly dark. Literally, not enough light. I watched this on a good television, my computer, an ipad, and in a dark room. It was so difficult to see the expressions due to the poor lighting. Also, the part of the story that takes place in a storm is ridiculous. The fake wind is so loud, you can barely hear the actors lines. That with the bad lighting, it felt a bit pointless. The fake snow didn't help. Too bad because the acting, of what I could see and hear, was brilliant.",en_0356737,3

A Bit Over Rated,"The Specs say 1000 lumens max. I compared this against a relatively new LED flashlight from a different producer. That other flashlight was rated 300 lumens and it seemed to produce more light output than this flashlight when operating with a freshly charged battery and at the high power setting. I'm not saying that this is a Bad flashlight - I got it on a lightning deal for a pretty good price, but I really don't think the 1,000 lumen rating is realistic. I put it closer to 200 or so based on a comparison with a light rated at 300, and a few LED Mag Lite Replacements that are rated at a bit over 200. To measure light output accurately requires expensive equipment that few people have access to - so this is just doing things by eye - but I don't think my eyesight is that bad.....

Puppy Divider with 2-door Crate is not Functional,"I purchased the 33"" and 36"" crate for the bedroom and one for the family area. I purposely purchased the 2 door for both so I can have options to position in either room although when using the puppy divider it clips on the side door so this door is not functional until the divider is not longer needed. Also, the divider clips well to one side but is loose on the other side and it is not a tight fit for safety. I did call Midwest support and they were very nice. They did confirm that with a 2 door the divider does not work. They requested pictures of the clasping issue with the divider on one side. Not sure there is anything to be done and my little girl is coming home in 2 days so I will just deal with it. It is a sturdy crate and has little rubber rollers on the bottom to help moving but take care moving over hardwood floors as it did touch it somehow without lifting and just rolling.

My daughter has been riding the bike to school and back for about a year. The headset (where the handlebar connects) requires re-tightening every few months. The brakes are a weak spot on this bicycle, they are finicky to adjust and need readjustment every month. The shifting system works as you'd expect for a $200 bicycle, clicks into gear but is not smooth. We haven't experience any of the chain issues some others have mentioned. Lastly, I'm disappointed in the quality of the bolts/nuts used on the bike, the frame itself and most of the components seem to be of decent quality, but the bolts had surface rust after the first winter (and we live in california so we rarely even have rain, just typical morning dew).",en_0831646,3

Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(,"This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!",en_0325147,3

"Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use","It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase. The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.",en_0470157,3

Ok case with serious limitations,"This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.",en_0663113,3

unfulfilled potential,"I love a lot of things about these slippers. They are adorable - true to photo. The high-top design of the opening not only keeps my ankles warm, it also keeps the slippers from coming off easily -- and from shopping around, this seems like a pretty unique feature. The slippers are very well-padded and feel very snug on the foot (although most of the padding is actually on top of the foot; there's not much padding on the sole, so if you're walking in these a lot, it will probably flatten.) All of these aspects make me really want to love these slippers. BUT I'm so let down by the fabrication. They seem to have focused entirely on the exterior of the slipper and ignored the interior. I want these to keep my feet cozy. But the interior fabric is not very soft, and doesn't feel good on my feet. Even worse, there is an exposed seam running around the interior of the slipper -- i.e. the fabric is sewn together, and the two ends are not tucked behind the seam, but extrude into the interior of the slipper and poke into my feet. Basically, every time I wear these I want to put on socks, to make my feet more comfortable -- but if I'm already going to put socks on, I don't really need the slippers, so... NB: I followed other reviewers and ordered a size down than suggested by the sizing chart. The Medium fits perfect on my women's sz 6 feet.",en_0643693,3

And when it fell apart the first time I didn't and then I guess my hand tightening wasn't enough. I've still yet to dig around to fine the correct size tool to fix it. I don't even see why it is so easy to take apart? Also I wish I would have gotten a tool with a 15mm. On it's own it wouldn't be a huge deal especially since a couple of my bikes don't need it, but enough of the bikes I work on do. Even if it was like an optional side item.

In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence. I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.

"Will keep them from biting their body, not from scratching their head.","Used with an adult cat. Based on other reviews I should note there are two main reasons for a cone.

The cat does not like it as much as the clear plastic cones, but any of those big enough to keep him from licking his sores also prevent him from eating and drinking. This keeps him from reaching his incision (rear leg amputated) with his mouth, but he can still get to food because it is cloth.

Sewing Desk,"Good size desk for sewing with draws for storage of parts and thread, and a draw for storing a sewing machine.

Either they fit tight in the desk slides or did not align flush to each other on the front. One draw side had to be plugged and re-drilled to allow the draw slide to fit properly. The wrong guide bumpers for the machine draw were packed with the parts, which the company said it was aware of, but is shipping out the replacement parts. An option we would have liked would be to be able to switch the base pieces to opposite sides, but that cause a little more work and may up the cost of the unit.

Loved Collins... It took a while to warm up to Grady,"3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.",en_0483721,3

Great frame but the rest of the bike parts made cheaply,"I purchased this bike for the sole function of being able to be folded in half so I can fit it in a car easier. As far as accomplishing that task, it is wonderful. Now to the nitty gritty. The bike comes with a Shimano rear derailleur, which works well as you would expect from a known reliable manufacturer. However, both of the shifters and the front derailleur are cheap aftermarket brand and NOT Shimano, despite how it is described. The shifters are loose between each gear stage, and too stiff to shift up to higher gears in some cases. The front derailleur is very difficult to adjust because of its cheap make, and the metal it is made out of is also very cheap and the whole derailer became unusable after spending some time just trying to get it adjusted. The seat pole is too long and interferes with the frame suspension, but that can be easily solved by cutting off a few inches of the pole. Basically, if you're someone who knows a lot about bicycles and how they work, this is a great bicycle frame with a unique design that can be very useful, but out of the package it immediately will need a few modifications and new front derailleur and new shifters if you plan to use this for serious riding.",en_0568800,3

Good steps for my Jeep,Very easy to install. Took me no more than 30 minutes total. They look amazing!

Crayola colored 12 count pencils,"Crayola 12 count colored pencils hold up well to the pressure on the paper. The tip does not break easily and the colors are very vivid as expected with this brand. The downside is that the pencils are the standard size and not really great for young elementary and preschool age. A smaller (length pencil) would have been better. I don't feel like sharpening the pencil all the way down for each one, so it works well enough for now. This brand consistently makes good coloring items and this is no exception. I just think I would have spent a little more time researching the length of the pencil in the future. I was also surprised to find a two pack of colored pencils about the same price with prime as the one pack from a different seller.",en_0370560,4

Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target.

"Nice Looks, Good Value","I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan.",en_0519424,4

Night patrol,"This is the story of a police night patrol featuring two (partners) officers. It is realistic and interesting -- depicts what officers do most of the time, and this makes it different. The novel is not a thriller nor a mystery, per se, more the routine of a night patrol. There is a human element as the reader sees into the lives and minds of the featured officers. As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series.

A great product but sloppy bushings.,"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed. As a result, the seat can actually rock side to side a little. This does not bother me at all when riding, and may actually be a benefit, but I worry that it will get worse as it wears. Regardless, what this seat post does is transform your hard tail bike into something you‚Äôll will want to ride more, and it makes the bike more capable. I currently have it on a fat bike. I have another good full suspension trail bike, but I doubt that I‚Äôll buy another FS bike, ‚Äòcause you can get a hard tail and still have comfort if equipped with this post.",en_0494424,4

Not worth returning not worth rebuying,"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",en_0538855,4

Awesome garlic press,This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product.

Cool concept! Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product,"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",en_0522818,4

Loved Lord,"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",en_0693712,4

Recommended for small spaces,"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable. I'm happy with my purchase.",en_0940539,4
Does what it's supposed to do,"This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze.

Just as described,"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign.

Has Potential To Be Great !,"This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that‚Äôs right RUST. Perhaps it‚Äôs from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn‚Äôt bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn‚Äôt shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don‚Äôt get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though.",en_0623228,4

Like the kid stuff was an after thought to lighten it up and broaden the audience. Again, I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it had been all fun",en_0614549,4

Women's Two-Piece African Print Halter Ruffle Swimsuit,"Though the top was a tad big on me, it wasn't enough to kill the overall vibe and look of the swimsuit.

"Remember, it's a chipper","This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",en_0082893,4

Easy to install?????,"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",en_0593814,4

Also, make sure it fits loose on your male pup and that the elastic doesn‚Äôt rest directly on his privates..when it‚Äôs too tight, it hurts their privates and causes irritation, rash, bruising and scabbing.

All around good buy,"Update after 3 months: Still great. Comfortable & fits well. Just the slightest sign of wear on edge near point of attachment. No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later. The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2. I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise. So far there aren't any wear marks around the buckle. All in all a good deal.",en_0061102,5

The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself.

Does the job,"My brothers and I, all veterans, wanted to replace my dads flagpole for his birthday. I'm not sure what we expected as far as the circumference of light illuminating the flag but I consider this perfect as both of my parents were able to see the flag and have commented on it several times. Just what we wanted. I would ask folks to understand that this light is really for home use and does not illuminate a large area on the ground. As it is mounted on top of the pole the circumference of light is smaller and stronger at the top while larger and weaker on the ground. Thus don't expect your flag and pole to be lit like a government building. If you want that, buy a different commercial grade light.",en_0023347,5

It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide).

This is an amazing little lift,"We bought this to do something unusual for a motorcycle lift.

So I bought this lift to raise her up about 6 inches and it works great. I have a high torque drill and uses it to rotate the mechanism. It works well! But, one question I plan to write the seller is: Because we are not lifting up some thing that is centered, the lift developed a side to side looseness that I want to fix. I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.",en_0158699,5

She really meets up with some interesting characters. And of course everyone is telling her what they know--the phone is ringing off the hook--and she is using a lot of gas!!

What a start to the Will Trent series.,I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish.

A good read!,Lucas. This book was interesting. I was surprised at how determined Lucas was to make Jasmine his. The issues Jasmine carried around kept her from having a relationship with any man.

With this device, I can send outputs from three sources to my TV: a cable box; a DVD player; and a ChromeCast device. Simply press the switch button to select the source of choice. Also, this box is very small; fits in the palm of your hand, so is easily hidden behind other equipment. I rarely give a five star review, but its justified in this case",en_0247806,5

Hearts and Tears...So Amazing!,"HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE!!! This story is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Here you have tragic events that ripped my heart out, then you have a swoon worthy romance that was sexy, sweet, and just made me believe in love, on to the nosey spiteful small town drama, heartbreak, and ending it all with a warm sweet feeling that I just didn't want to be over. Wyatt and Hannah are two of the most relatable characters that I have experienced this year. Out of all the books that I have read, these two rank pretty high in my memorable couples list. I just want more and more, I was so sad when I got to the end because I just wanted to keep their story going. This specific video review will be included in the October 2018 wrap-up.

I Iike how you can convert it from rectangular to square. It hasn‚Äôt been running long, but so far it hasn‚Äôt heated up a lot.

Sebastian and Zane,"I really enjoyed Sebastian. He's a true optimist that seeks out the good in everyone and everything, but he's also insightful. He sees Zane's standoffish behavior and knows that he's struggling with something painful. Sebastian offers a listening ear, friendship, and comfort. Zane is stewing in grief and there are moments when it overwhelms him. Sebastian shows up every time, just being a quiet presence. It was wonderful to watch these two so quickly fall, they take a bit to acknowledge their feelings. Lovely ending.",en_0124226,5
